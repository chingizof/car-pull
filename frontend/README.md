FlyWheel - Lehigh University carpooling app!

There are currently two options on how to take a trip via carpool as a passenger:

1. Book a trip by entering the departure place, the arrival place, and the time of the trip. The student drivers will send you their offerings based on your request. Choose an optimal one that fits your preferences on the car, capacity, and price.
2. Sign up for a trip offering from a driver. Student drivers can create trip alerts for potential passengers, which would be especially convenient for long distance traveling.

Also, there is a safety policy developed in collaboration with the Univesity that provides the security of both passengers and drivers in the app.
